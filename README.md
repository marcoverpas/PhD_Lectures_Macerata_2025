# Lecture_A_The_Monetary_Circuit_Theory

## A1_The_Endogenous_Money_View

### A1.1 Introduction

The (Italian strand of the) [Monetary Circuit Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_circuit_theory) (MCT) is the culmination of a research line initiated by Augusto Graziani in the late 1970s, but only fully developed during the following decade. The MCT offers an original reinterpretation of some of the most significant aspects of Karl Marx's analysis, which resembles heterodox monetary views within the history of 20th-century economic thought.

This perspective draws on a subterranean strand of studies originating from Knut Wicksell's *Interest and Prices* (1898), progressing through the Swedish School and the works of Hahn and Robertson, and culminating in Schumpeter's monetary works and Keynes's *Treatise on Money* (1930). However, it is primarily to the works of certain French authors, notably Jaques Le Bourva and especially Bernard Schmitt, that the first attempt to construct a general macro-monetary theory, as an alternative and rival to neoclassical approaches, can be attributed.

It is no secret that the authors cited differ, sometimes radically, in their approaches. Nonetheless, Graziani's research programme demonstrates that divergences are less significant than the shared aspects. The latter, if carefully interpreted and integrated, are sufficient to form a coherent theoretical framework that constitutes the embryonic stage of a monetary theory of capitalist production.

A foundational analytical premise of this framework is the assimilation of Keynes's category of *finance* with Marx's concept of *money capital*, which assigns a central role to the relationship between money and production within the economic process. This approach enables a depiction of the functioning of capitalist market economies as a circular sequence of interconnected phases. The sequence begins with the granting of bank credit to non-financial firms, which provides them with the purchasing power needed to purchase labour power for production. The monetary circuit is only completed when firms realise the value of their production in monetary terms, repay their debts to banks, and distribute the surplus value between profits and interests.

The methodological and theoretical pillars of the MCT include:

1. the rejection of so-called methodological individualism in favour of an analysis that explicitly considers the hierarchy and differing roles of economic agents;

1. the adoption of a sequential analytical approach, in contrast to the neoclassical model of simultaneous equilibrium;
  
1. the principle of the endogenous determination of the money within the economic system;
  
1. lastly, the rejection of the neoclassical theory of income distribution.

Based on these presuppositions, the main purpose of the MCT is to identify the logical phases of the process of creation, destruction and circulation of money in a capitalist economy, inhabited by different and opposed social classes.

### A1.2 Alternative theories about the origin of money

#### A1.2.1 Money as a commodity

According to an initial theory, money emerges from the spontaneous interactions of self-interested individuals exchanging goods and services in the marketplace. In this conception, money functions as a lubricant or means of exchange. From barter to shells, salt, livestock, metallic coins, banknotes, and finally, the electronic impulses of banking payment systems, one can trace a historical evolution of the forms assumed by money. Trading (the act of giving one good in return for another) is viewed as intrinsic to human nature. Marginalist-neoclassical economists suggest that metallic money emerged among other goods due to its scarcity, durability, and ease of transport. In this framework, banknotes are merely representative titles for their underlying value, such as gold (or other precious metals).

This theory, however, faces two significant challenges. The first is theoretical: this conception relies on a framework where the subjective (marginal) utility derived from consuming a good or service forms the basis of its value and price. However, the utility of money is indirect, stemming from the goods or services it can purchase. This creates a logical circularity: the quantity of goods and services that can be bought depends on their prices in money, which, in turn, relies on money's exchange value. Thus, determining the utility and value of money requires prior knowledge of its value. While this issue can be resolved mathematically through the simultaneous determination of utility and value, co-determination is not logical causation.

The second challenge is historical: if we look back at history, only one type of money has dominated, that issued by the State, while private currencies have always played a secondary role.

#### A1.2.2 Money as a liability issued by the State

According to another theory, money emerged when sovereign authorities ceased acquiring resources through forced transfers of goods and services (as in feudal systems) and adopted a new approach: granting credit to those who provided their products or labour. The sovereign then required community members to periodically present and return a specified number of these credit certificates as proof of their contributions - that is, to pay monetary taxes. The value of these certificates, as a means of settling obligations to the State, made them a convenient medium of exchange among private individuals. This historical shift laid the groundwork for modern monetary economies. In this regard, notice that barter systems historically follow the collapse of payment systems, rather than preceding their establishment.

In other words, money does not arise solely from interactions between private individuals, nor is its value derived from indirect utility. Instead, the spread of State-backed money results from its legal tender status and its imposition as a tool for meeting tax obligations. As Georg F. Knapp argued, it is the power of the State, not spontaneous market forces, that transforms a commodity into money. While no one can be legally compelled to use a specific payment instrument, the State can make such instruments attractive through taxation.

This State theory of money not only sheds light on its origins but also suggests that money has a direct utility.

#### A1.2.3 Money as a store of value

As Keynes (1936) clarified, the desire to hold money reflects our distrust of the future. Its *utility* derives from its function as a *store of value*. Keynes referred to this phenomenon as the *liquidity preference*, which also explains the risk premium (spread) as the price demanded for parting with money (the only trusted means of payment) during crises. 

This second conception highlights an essential aspect to be discussed further: the *credit nature* of money. Money is not merely *a thing*. It is an economic and social *relationship*. A banknote represents a State liability towards the holder and, simultaneously, a credit for the holder against the State. Even when appearing as metallic currency, money is a zero-interest liability. For this reason, Keynes described the Indian rupee as a banknote printed on a piece of silver.

#### A1.2.4 Class struggle and money as a triangular relationship

A third group of scholars, closer to the State-theory of money but offering a distinct interpretation of its origin, draws on Marxist thought. They observe that once property becomes private rather than communal (as occurred historically, for instance, during the *enclosures* in 18th- and 19th-century England), products cease to be distributed equally among community members. Consequently, those whose incomes decrease must rely on debt to survive. Money thus becomes the general equivalent measuring the value of such obligations over time. Historically, the first banks were monasteries, issuing credit certificates to record deposits made in kind.

In sum, while money has a credit nature, as State money theorists argue, it is also a product of social interaction. Changes in social structures and class struggle dynamics have played a far more significant role than is often acknowledged.

Moreover, the explanation of money as a store of value (or liquidity) has a critical limitation undermining its generality: it explains money only in contexts of crisis and uncertainty. If crises and uncertainty were somehow eliminated, money would serve solely as a unit of account and means of exchange. In a perfectly balanced economy, no residual stock of money would remain at the end of transactions.

This idea has been challenged by some heterodox French and Italian economists in the late 20th century, named *circuitists*. They argue that the necessity of money in a monetary production economy, or capitalist economy, must also be explained in a *crisis-free* world. This does not deny the capitalist system's propensity for recurrent crises. On the contrary, to illuminate the inherently monetary nature of production and exchange relations in a capitalist economy, one must explain the function of money beyond its role as a store of value during dark times.

#### A1.2.5 Between Marx and Keynes

In the preliminary drafts of his *General Theory*, Keynes makes an interesting, albeit unexpected, reference to the second volume of Marx's *Capital*. In that volume, published posthumously by Engels in 1885, Marx clarifies that there are two distinct forms of exchange or circulation of goods in a capitalist society: simple circulation (selling to buy) and capitalist circulation (buying to sell).

In the first form, which characterises a pre-capitalist market - or what Hyman Minsky might have called a *village fair* - the ultimate goal is to exchange one use value for another. Money here serves solely as a facilitator of exchange.

In the second form, the essence of capitalism is revealed: the capitalist or the firm purchases labour force and means of production to be used in the production process, the end result of which is products that are sold in the market. The ultimate goal here is not the acquisition of specific use-values, but the realisation of a monetary surplus. This is because capitalism is not merely a system of producing commodities by means of commodities (a reference, of course, to Piero Sraffa, 1960), but also, and more importantly, a system of producing *more money* by means of money - that is, a monetary system of production and accumulation.

Building on this insight of Marx, which Keynes revisited, it is therefore possible to argue that the most important, yet often overlooked, function of money in a capitalist system is *to finance the production plans* of firms.

This initial finance provided by banks enables firms to purchase the necessary labour power in the market to produce goods and services. Wage earners will then spend their income on consumption or portfolio investments. In this way, (part of) the money paid out as wages will return to the firms, allowing them to repay the financing received from the banks.

This framework is known as the *monetary circuit model*. It sheds light on the *endogenous flow* nature of money, in contrast to the idea of money as an *exogenous stock* (linked to the conception of money as a lubricant of exchange) and as a complement to the idea of money as an *endogenous stock* (linked to Keynesian crisis theory). Two immediate implications or corollaries follow from this. The first corollary concerns the disappearance of the money multiplier. The second corollary concerns the relationship between money and prices.


### A1.3 Implications from an endogenous theory of money

#### A1.3.1 The disappearance of the money multiplier 

For several years now, the so-called money multiplier has disappeared: both in the data, as lamented by Gregory Mankiw in a [2009 blog post](https://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/01/disappearing-money-multiplier.html), and in theory, as evidenced by the curious disappearance of chapters dedicated to the money multiplier in Olivier Blanchard's renowned [macroeconomics textbook](https://www.pearson.com/en-gb/subject-catalog/p/macroeconomics-a-european-perspective/P200000003747/9781292360911?tab=table-of-contents).

</figure>

But what is the money multiplier? In brief, it is the idea that banks can expand the amount of money in circulation starting from an initial deposit, thanks to the fractional reserve system. For example, if a bank collects deposits of $`€100`$ and the reserve requirement imposed by monetary authorities is $`10\%`$, that bank can lend $`€90`$. Assuming, for simplicity, that the public does not wish to hold cash, those €90 will be deposited in another bank, which, in turn, can then lend $`€81`$ ($`€90`$ minus the $`€9`$ to be set aside as reserves), and so on. Generalising, with a reserve ratio of $`θ`$, each additional euro of liquidity (reserves) made available to banks by the central bank will lead to a total amount of deposits and loans equal to: $`€1 × [(1-θ) + (1-θ)^2 + (1-θ)^3 + ...]`$. Since $`θ < 1`$, the expression in square brackets is a convergent geometric series, the value of which is: $`1/θ > 1`$. Returning to our example, the value of the multiplier will be $`1/0.10 = 10`$, so the amount of bank money created from a deposit of $`€100`$ will be: $`€100 × 10 = €1000`$.

So, what is wrong with the above story? In short, everything. First, reserves are liquid assets held by commercial banks at the central bank and used in their mutual relations in the interbank market. These assets are not (and cannot be) ['lent out' to customers](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/mrcbg/programs/senior.fellows/2019-20%20fellows/BanksCannotLendOutReservesAug2013_%20(002).pdf). Second, as we clarify in section (`A3`), banks do not simply act as intermediaries between depositors and borrowers. On the contrary, they actively create deposits through the issuance of loans. Thus, it is the latter that create the former, not vice versa. Third, the reserve requirement is not there or has been abolished in many advanced economies (including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia), without these economies experiencing explosions in the process of bank money creation (note that $`1/θ → +∞`$ as $`θ → 0`$). Moreover, even where present, this requirement does not have to be met at every instant, but over a sufficiently long period, known as the maintenance period (about [six weeks in the Euro Area](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/calendars/reserve/html/index.it.html), where a reserve requirement of 1% applies). This means that banks are never constrained in their lending activity by the availability of reserves, but only by the presence of solvent and profitable customers (and within the limits of the capital requirements set by the [Basel Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III)). Reserves can be replenished *ex post* through the interbank market or by directly resorting to the central bank (which must always provide the system with the required reserves if it wants the market interest rate to reflect the announced policy rate). In short, the so-called money multiplier is merely a ratio derivable *ex post* from the accounting identity that defines reserves as a percentage of deposits (reserves = $`θ`$ × deposits, *hence* deposits = reserves / $`θ`$). To quote Shakespeare, much ado about nothing.

#### A1.3.2 The relationship between money and prices

The second corollary relates to the interpretation of Irving Fisher's [equation of exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange). This is, once again, an accounting identity that asserts that the value of goods exchanged is equal to the value of the money used for the exchange. In formula: $`Y × P = M × V`$, where $`Y`$ is an indicator of the volume of production (or a vector of physical quantities of goods), $`P`$ is the general price level (or a vector of unit prices for each good), $`M`$ is the total quantity of money, and $`V`$ is its velocity of circulation (i.e., the number of times it changes hands). The [quantity theory of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money#:~:text=The%20quantity%20theory%20of%20money,runs%20from%20money%20to%20prices.) - pioneered by David Hume, accepted by David Ricardo and revived in the 1950s by Milton Friedman - asserts that, since production tends to a natural level defined by technology and the availability of factors, while the velocity of circulation of money is rather stable, it is possible to establish a direct relationship between the quantity of money injected into the system by monetary authorities and the price level: $`P = M × \bar{V} / \bar{Y}`$. Hence Friedman's famous statement that 'inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon'.

However, the monetary and financial instability that has characterised the major world economies since the late 1970s has shown that the velocity of circulation of money is anything but stable, increasing during expansion phases and plummeting during recessions (as predicted by Keynes and Minsky, intuited before them by Thornton and Marx, and reluctantly acknowledged by Mankiw). Moreover, the possibility of defining a natural level of production independent of demand conditions and thus of firms' investments is blatantly contradicted by the need to continuously revise estimates of potential GDP. Finally, for years, the world's major central banks have abandoned any ambition to control monetary aggregates (the most striking case being the abandonment of the [second pillar of the ECB's monetary policy](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/pp37_48_mb200011en.pdf)) to focus on regulating the policy interest rate, letting the supply of base money adjust to demand (through open market operations that play a passive adjustment role, not an active determination of monetary aggregates, as this would clash with the setting of the reference rate for the markets).

The point is that the relationship between money and prices is much weaker than is commonly believed, while the direction of dominant causation is reversed compared to that postulated by the quantity theory of money. Consider, for example, an increase in the price of raw materials. This will increase production costs for firms, which, at a given interest rate, will request more financing (loans) from banks. These will translate into more deposits, which, in turn, will require more reserves injected into the system by the central bank. Thus, it was not the greater injection of base money that generated the rise in prices, but the latter that generated the former (see the diagram below, developed by Fontana and Setterfield [2009a](https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1504/IJPEE.2009.02897), [2009b](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-230-29166-9_9)).

## A2_Presuppositions_of_the_MCT

According to [Graziani](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/monetary-theory-of-production/A813BE586E79CDF0DE7C3D930DBF632F) (2006, pp. 25-26) the main theoretical presuppositions of the MCT are:

1. Money is in the nature of credit money (bank credit).

1. Credit money is created whenever an agent spends money granted to her by a bank and is destroyed whenever a bank credit is repaid.

1. Money is an endogenous flow: it is created and injected into the economy by means of negotiations between banks and firms.

1. Class divide matters: since firms have access to bank credit *at the beginning of the circuit*, they enjoy a purchasing power that is not constrained by the level of real income (or wealth). By constrast, wage earners can only spend alread-yearned incomes.

1. Since agents are not granted credit on the same footing, the system of relative prices reflects the way in which purchasing power has been granted to different social groups. As a consequence, money is never neutral.

1. A complete theoretical analysis must explain the whole itinerary followed by money: creation, circulation, and destruction. Money existence and operation can be described as a *circuit*.

1. The creation of money determines both the division of production between consumption and investment goods and the distribution of income between wages and profits. Therefore, the role of money goes far beyond that of lubricant of exchanges (and store of value). To the firms, the initial access to money is the source of profits.


## A3_A_Simple_MCT_Model

The the simplest version of the monetary circuit, only four agents are considered: the central bank, commercial banks, production firms, and wage earners. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that intrest rates on both bank deposits and loans are equal to zero. 

:bank: **Step 1: money creation**. Commercial banks grant credit to firms, thus enabling them to start the process of production. This credit flow is denominated *initial finance*. Only frms are admitted to bank credit *at this stage*. If firms are considered as one integrated and consolidated sector, the only purchase they have to make is that of labour power. Therefore, their only payment is the wage bill. As a result, the wage policy of the firms ultimately depends on the credit policy of the banks.

:factory: **Step 2: production and money circulation**. Firms autonomously decide both the employment level and the amount of consumer goods and investment goods produced. Wage earners can only decide how to distribute their money income between consumption and saving, and how to allocate their saving, which can take the form of either bank deposits or securities (here only private securities).

:hamburger: **Step 3: sales on the goods market**. Goods produced are put on sale. Consumer goods are sold to wage earners, while investment goods are exchanged inside the firms sector. The money that wage earners spend in the goods

:bank: **Step 5: money destruction**. Firms use the money spent by the wage earners on the markets to repay their bank debt. To the extent that bank debts are repaid, an equal amount of money is destroyed. To the extent instead that wage earners use their money to increase their own deposit holdings (or cash balances or government debt holdings), an equal amount of money remains in existence in the form of firms' debt and wage earners' credit towards the banks.

One might wonder whether firms can make monetary profits in this scheme and cover interest payments when the interest rate on loans is positive.

The answer to both questions is yes. First, once investment-related loans to individual firms are accounted for, the firm sector realises monetary (gross) profits equal to investment expenditures.

Second, there is no reason to assume that the *financial period* - which begins when bank loans are created and ends when they are repaid - must align with the *production and exchange period* - during which firms pay interest to banks using revenue from sales, enabling bank owners to receive and spend their incomes. If the financial period is longer than the production period, as seems reasonable to assume, then, in principle, firms can repay both the initial capital and the accrued interest (see [Zezza, 2012](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230367357_8), and [Veronese Passarella, 2024](https://www.elgaronline.com/view/journals/ejeep/21/3/article-p461.xml)).

## A4_Distribution_in_a_MCT_model

MCT theorists reject the basic idea of consumer sovereignty in favour of the opposite concept of producer sovereignty. Wage earners and firms enjoy differing levels of purchasing power in the goods market. The expenditure of wage earners is strictly limited by the budget constraint set by their wage income, while firms use bank credit to hire workers according to their own production plans. At the end of the production process, firms also purchase a fraction of the total output as means of production (investment goods). While an individual firm needs funding for its investment spending (in addition to wage costs), this is an internal exchange for the firm sector as a whole. As a result, firms can obtain from banks any amount of credit to fund the purchase of investment goods. This credit money will circulate from one firm to another without ever leaving the firm sector. Therefore, firms as a whole will never face difficulties in repaying this portion of their bank debt.

To understand how prices are set within a basic MCT scheme, consider the following system of equations (taken from [Graziani, 2006](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/monetary-theory-of-production/A813BE586E79CDF0DE7C3D930DBF632F)):

Aggregate supply is: 

$$X = pr \cdot N \quad \text{(1)} $$

where $pr$ is the average labour productivity and $N$ is the employment level.

Aggregate consumption is:

$$C = c \cdot (w \cdot N + r_b \cdot B) \quad \text{(2)} $$

where $c$ is the average and marginal propensity to consume out of income, $w$ is the wage rate, $r_b$ is the related interest rate, and $B$ is the stock of private securities held by the wage earners.

Aggregate investment is:

$$I = b \cdot pr \cdot N \cdot p \quad \text{(3)} $$

where $b$ is the share of real investment to total output, and $p$ is the unit price.

The equilibrium price level is determined by the equality between aggregate supply and aggregate demand:

$$ pr \cdot N \cdot p = c \cdot (w \cdot N + r_b \cdot B) + b \cdot pr \cdot N \cdot p  $$

from which we obtain:

$$ p = \frac{1-s}{1-b} \cdot \left[ \frac{w}{pr} + \frac{r_b \cdot B}{pr \cdot N} \right] \quad \text{(4)} $$

where $s=1-c$ is propensity to save out of income.

It follows that:

- The unit price does not depend on the quantity of money.

- The price depends on the propensities to save and to invest, and on the level of money costs.

- Each variation in the unit price will produce a proportional variation in the money stock (for any value of the velocity of ciculation of money).

The average real income of wage earners is:

$$ \frac{w + r_b \cdot (B/N)}{p} = ... = \frac{1-b}{1-s} \cdot pr \quad \text{(5)} $$

Real consumption is therefore:

$$ \frac{C}{p} = (1-b) \cdot pr \quad \text{(6)} $$

The average real consumption of wage earners depends on both the average productivity of labour (+) and the share of firms' investment (-).

The profit rate for the firms sector is:

$$ r_f = \frac{pr \cdot N \cdot p - (w \cdot N + r_b \cdot B)}{w \cdot N + r_b \cdot B } = \frac{b-s}{1-b} \quad \text{(7)} $$

Total (monetary) profits are:

$$ \Pi = r_f \cdot (w \cdot N + r_b \cdot B) = \frac{b-s}{1-b} \cdot (w \cdot N + r_b \cdot B)\quad \text{(8)} $$

Total profits, expressed in real terms, are:

$$ \frac{\Pi}{p} = \frac{b-s}{1-s} \cdot pr \cdot N \quad \text{(9)} $$

The following implications hold:

- The level of profits depends directly on the level of money prices (because they depend on $`r_f`$, which, in turn, depends on $`p`$). 

- Real profits do not depend on the interest rate paid by firms on the securities they issue. A consequence is that any attempt to influence investment decisions by controlling the rate of interest is bound to be ineffective.

- If, by chance, $` s = b `$, prices equal the monetary costs of production, hence profits = 0.

- If $` s = 0 `$, real profits = real investment.

Lastly, note that net profits must be calculated net of interests paid to the banks:

$$ \Pi_n = r_f \cdot (w \cdot N + r_b \cdot B) - r_l \cdot \lambda( \bar{r}_b ) \cdot (w \cdot N + r_b \cdot B) \quad \text{(10)} $$

where $` \lambda `$ is workers' deposit holdings to total income ratio, defined as a negative function of the interest rate on private securities, and $` r_l `$ is the interest rate on bank loans to firms.

An increase in the interest rate paid by firms on securities produces contrasting consequences, as it reduces $` \lambda `$ but increases $` r_b \cdot B `$.

*Note*: for a dynamic rendition of the MCT model, see [B3 Model BMW](#B3_Model_BMW).

## A5_Policy_implications

### A5.1 Monetary policy

If money is endogenous, an increase in money prices brings about a proportional increase in the bank debt of the firms. As a result, an increase in the rate of interest further increases the annual financial burden falling on firms. 

Even assuming costant wages, firms can be affected on the credit market. Inflation produces a redistribution of gross profits from the firms to the banks, which implies a decline in industrial profits and an increase in financial incomes.

While the firms can compensate for losses in the labour market by increasing money prices - see *equation (`4`)* - they are unable to compensate for losses in the credit market due to the increase in the interest rate.

The contraction of profits can be mitigated by reducing the policy rate and enhancing the liquidity and marketability of firms' securities.

### A5.2 Fiscal policy

It can be demonstrated that, if we add taxation and government spending to the equations above, the results still hold. Intuitively, if firms can decide both the level and the composition of output, fiscal policies can only (directly) influence the unit price.

For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that interest rates are equal to zero. The unit price of output becomes: 

$$ p = \frac{(1-s) \cdot (1-t)}{(1-b-g)} \cdot \frac{w}{pr} \quad \text{(4.A)} $$

where $` g `$ is the share of output purchased by the government sector and $` t `$ is the average tax rate on income.

The higher the government spending (however funded) and the lower the tax rate, the higher the unit price will be. However, it is apparent that real profits, and hence real wages, are not (directly) affected by government spending and taxation - refer to *equation (`9`)*.

The reason is that the distribution of real income between wages and profits is strictly connected to the independent decisions of firms about the subdivision of output between consumption goods and investment goods.

These decisions (can) override any redistribution performed by taxation and subsidies, which do not affect (directly) the distribution of real income. The main policy implication is that, if the government wants to alter the distribution of real income in favour of wages, it should mainly provide goods and services in real terms.

# Lecture_B_Stock-Flow_Consistent_Models

## B1_Introduction_to_SFC_Models

In the last three decades, macroeconomic modelling has been dominated by Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models. However, dissatisfaction with these models has been growing since the mid-2000s. Three primary weaknesses have been identified in DSGE models: [unrealistic assumptions, a limited range of considerations, and poor data fit](https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2018/mar/meet-martin-the-rbas-new-macroeconomic-model.html).

In response to these shortcomings, alternative models have emerged, aiming to address specific deficiencies. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models allow for broadening the scope but usually share key neoclassical assumptions with DSGE models. Leontief-like Input-Output (IO) models provide more room for a sound analysis of cross-industry interdependencies and the role of aggregate demand, but they still face limitations (as these models are static in nature, and their coverage of financial aspects is usually quite limited). Heterogeneous agent-based models, network analysis, and other complexity models offer novel perspectives. Lastly, Stock-Flow Consistent (SFC) models have gained traction, finding applications in empirical macroeconomic research by institutions like the [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2016/a-dynamic-model-of-financial-balances-for-the-uk) and the [Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264999322003509).

The resurgence of interest in SFC models can be traced back to Wynne Godley's [successful predictions](https://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/seven-unsustainable-processes) of the U.S. crises in 2001 and 2007. Godley's work laid the foundation for modern SFC modelling. These models, rooted in national accounts and flow of funds, integrate financial and real aspects of the economy, allowing for the identification of unsustainable processes.

SFC models are akin to [system dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics#:~:text=System%20dynamics%20(SD)%20is%20an,table%20functions%20and%20time%20delays.) models, analysing complex systems over time, tracking flows, stocks, and utilising feedback loops. Basic SFC models have evolved into various forms, including Open-Economy or Multi-Area SFC models (MA-SFC), Ecological SFC models (ECO-SFC), Interacting Heterogeneous Agent-Based SFC models (AB-SFC), Input-output SFC Models (IO-SFC), and Empirical SFC Models (E-SFC).

Crucially, SFC models adhere to four accounting principles: flow consistency, stock consistency, stock-flow consistency, and quadruple book-keeping. The economy is represented by accounting matrices, identities reflecting the [System of National Accounts](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna2008.asp), and dynamic equations defining the behaviour of each sector (usually based on rules of thumb and stock-flow norms).

Standard SFC models typically fall within the range of medium-scale macro-econometric dynamic models. These models are commonly formulated in discrete time using difference equations. However, continuous-time formulations using differential equations are also employed. 

The simplicity or complexity of SFC models dictates the approach to solving them. The simplest models, featuring a limited number of equations, can be solved analytically by finding steady-state solutions. These solutions provide insights into the long-term behaviour of the model. More advanced SFC models, characterised by increased complexity and a larger number of equations, necessitate computational methods. Computer simulations become essential for understanding the dynamic interactions within the system. Numerical techniques, such as iterative methods, are employed to capture the intricate dynamics of these models.

![fig_lang](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcoverpas/figures/main/languages.png)

Coefficients in SFC models play a crucial role in shaping model behaviour. Researchers have several options for determining these coefficients:

a) **Fine-tuning**: coefficients can be fine-tuned to achieve specific baseline scenarios, drawing insights from previous studies or selecting values from a reasonable range.

b) **Calibration**: researchers may calibrate coefficients to match the model's predictions with observed data, to achieve a predefined steady state, or to align the model with real-world economic conditions.

c) **Estimation**: econometric methods, including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and cointegration techniques, enable the estimation of coefficients from observed data, enhancing the model's empirical robustness.

Unlike DSGE models, which often rely on a unified platform like `Dynare`, SFC modeling lacks a universally adopted program. The pioneering codes used in Godley and Lavoie's work were developed by [Gennaro Zezza](https://gennaro.zezza.it/software/eviews/gl2006.php) using `EViews` and `Excel`. However, the landscape has evolved over time. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) ([RStudio](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-new-open-source-ide-for-r/)) has become the predominant programming environment for SFC modeling, owing to its flexibility and extensive capabilities. Dedicated `R` packages such as [SFCR](https://joaomacalos.github.io/sfcr/index.html) and [Godley](https://github.com/gamrot/godley/) provide specialised tools for SFC modeling. Additionally, [Bimets](https://github.com/andrea-luciani) offers a platform for empirical SFC model development. Alternative programming languages, including [MATLAB](https://github.com/marcoverpas/SFC-models-Matlab) (with or without `Dynare`), `Mathematica`, [Python](https://github.com/marcoverpas/SFC-models-Jupyter), and `Julia`, find applications in SFC modeling, particularly for creating agent-based SFC models. [Minsky](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2123355930/minsky-reforming-economics-with-visual-monetary-mo), a software package developed by Steve Keen, stands out as a tool for visually modeling macroeconomic system dynamics.

Summing up, while there are many online resources today for those interested in engaging with SFC modeling, the community of SFC modelers lacks a portal that consolidates the produced material, which is abundant but still scattered.

The aim of this lecture is to provide a simple introduction to SFC models (including IO-SFC and ECO-SFC models) by using a hand-on approach. For a theoretical introduction to SFC model, please refer to [Monetary Economics. An Integrated Approach to Credit, Money, Income, Production and Wealth](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3) by Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie. 

## B2_Model_PC

This is one of the simplest SFC toy models and will we use it as our benchmark model. It is developed in chapter 4 of "[Monetary Economics. An Integrated Approach to Credit, Money, Income, Production and Wealth](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3)". **PC** stands for "portfolio choice", because households can hold their wealth in terms of cash and/or government bills.

Key assumptions are as follows:

1. Closed economy

1. Four agents: households, “firms”, government, central bank

1. Two financial assets: government bills and outside money (cash)

1. No investment (accumulation) and no inventories

1. Fixed prices and zero net profits

1. No banks, no inside money (bank deposits)

1. No ecosystem

The structure of Model PC is quite simple. Crucial identities of the model are derived using the balance-sheet matrix and the transaction-flow matrix. These tables are also useful to double-check model consistency in each period.

*Note*: The code needed to generate **Table 1** and **Table 2** can be accessed [here](https://github.com/marcoverpas/EAEPE_summer_school_2024/blob/main/eaepe_io_tables.R).

Completing the identities derived from the tables above with behavioural equations for taxes, consumption, demand for bills, and the interest rate, we obtain the system of difference equations presented below.

We start with the equation defining national income (identity), which is: 

$$Y = C + G \quad \text{(1)} $$

where $C$ is household consumption and $G$ is government expenditure.

Households'disposable income (identity) is:

$$YD = Y - T + r_{-1} \cdot B_{h,-1} \quad \text{(2)} $$

where $r$ is the interest rate and $B_h$ is households' holdings of bills. The subscript $-1$ stands for lagged variable.

Tax revenue (behavioural) is:

$$T = \theta \cdot (Y +  r_{-1} \cdot B_{h,-1} ) \quad \text{(3)} $$

where $\theta$ is the average tax rate on total income before taxes.

Households' wealth (identity) is:

$$V_h = V_{h,-1} + YD - C \quad \text{(4)} $$

Consumption (hehavioural) is:

$$C = \alpha_1 \cdot YD + \alpha_2 \cdot V_{-1} \quad \text{(5)} $$

where $\alpha_1$ is the propensity to consume out of income and $\alpha_2$ is the propensity to consume out of wealth.

Cash held by households (identity) is:

$$H_h = V_h - B_h \quad \text{(6)} $$

The value of bills held by households (behavioural) is:

$$\frac{B_h}{V_h} = \lambda_0 + \lambda_1 \cdot r - \lambda_2 \cdot \frac{YD}{V_h} \quad \text{(7)} $$

where $\lambda_0$ is the autonomous share of bills held by the households, $\lambda_1$ is the elasticity to the interest rate, and $\lambda_2$ captures households' liquidity preference.

The supply of bills (identity) is:

$$B_s = B_{s,-1} + G - T + r_{-1} \cdot ( B_{s,-1} - B_{cb,-1} ) \quad \text{(8)} $$

where $B_{cb}$ is the amount of bills held by the central bank.

The supply of cash (identity) is:

$$H_s = H_{s,-1} + \Delta B_{cb} \quad \text{(9)} $$

The value of bills held by central bank (identity) is:

$$B_{cb} = B_s - B_h \quad \text{(10)} $$

The interest rate (behavioural) is:

$$r = \bar{r} \quad \text{(11)} $$

where $\bar{r}$ is the policy rate set by the central bank.

Two additional points should be considered. So far, no private spending variable in Model PC is directly affected by the interest rate. We can relax this assumption by allowing the propensity to consume out of income to be a negative function of the interest rate on bills:

$$ \alpha_1 = \alpha_{10} - \alpha_{11} \cdot r_{-1}  \quad \text{(12)} $$

In addition, any complete and coherent model must contain an equation that is *redundant*, meaning that it is logically implied by all the others (*Walras' Law*). In Model PC, this is the equation matching the demanded stock of cash with central bank's supply of cash:

$$H_s = H_h $$

This equation must be excluded from the model, which is the reason it is sometimes called the *hidden equation*. However, it can be conveniently used to double-check the consistency of the model.

One of the advantages of using such a simple model as a basic model, is that we can calculate the (quasi) steady-state solution for national income $`Y`$. We can do that by observing that in the steady state there must be no saving ($`C=YD`$) and household holdings of bills are stable ($`B_{h,−1}=B_h=B_h^{*}`$). Using these conditions and equations (2) and (3) in $`Y`$, we otain: 

$$Y^{\*}= \frac{G + r \cdot B_h^{*} \cdot (1 − \theta)}{\theta}$$

where $`B_h^{*}`$ is the steady-state value of household stock of bills.

The model can be easily simulated by identifying the coefficients and attributing an initial value to government spending ($G=G_0$, with $G_0>0$).

## B3_Model_BMW

This is the simplest model explicitly including commercial banks. It is developed in chapter 7 of Godley and Lavoie (2007), "[Monetary Economics. An Integrated Approach to Credit, Money, Income, Production and Wealth](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3)". **BMW** stands for "bank-money world", because there is only one kind of financial assets: bank deposits held by households. Firms’ investment in fixed capital is funded by bank loans and amortisation funds. This model can be regarded as the dynamic counterpart of the MCT basic (static) model without security issues. 

Key assumptions are as follows:

1. Closed economy and no ecosystem

1. Three agents: households, firms, banks

1. Assets and liabilities include: loans, deposits, tangible (or fixed) capital

1. Investment funded by loans and internal funds

1. Target capital to output ratio

1. Fixed prices and zero net profits

1. No State, no outside money (cash)


The structure of Model BMW is slightly different from that of model PC. However, as usual, crucial identities of the model are derived using the balance-sheet matrix and the transaction-flow matrix.  

#### Table 1. Balance sheet matrix

While all rows related to financial assets/liabilities must sum to zero, the row related to fixed capital does not, because tangible capital is only an asset for the economy. In addition, since it is assumed that banks and firms do not make net profits, households' net wealth must be exacly equal to the stock of tangible capital.

Model BMW is now complete. The redundant or hidden equation can be derived from the last row of the TFM table, which requires that:

$$ \Delta M_h = \Delta M_s $$

This equation is excluded from the model and used to double-check its watertightness.

The charts below show the evolution of selected variables following different shocks.

#### APPENDIX: PRODUCTION FINANCING OR INVESTMENT FUNDING?

Equation *(`B.8`)* deserves a few additional comments. According to the MCT, firms use bank credit to cover production costs (wages) at the beginning of each period. This initial finance ($FIN_i$) is:

$$
FIN_i = w \cdot N_d \quad \text{(C.1)}
$$

By contrast, the final funding ($FIN_f$) that the firms obtain at the end of each period is:

$$
FIN_f = C_s - r_l \cdot L_d - (\Pi - AF) \quad \text{(C.2)}
$$

where $`\Pi`$ is total profit, hence ($`\Pi - AF`$) is distributed profits.

We can now calculate the change in the stock of loans recorded at the end of the period, which is:

$$
\Delta L_d = FIN_i - FIN_f = w \cdot N_d - \left[ C_s - r_l \cdot L_d - (\Pi - AF) \right] \quad \text{(C.3)}
$$

Incidentally, equation (`C.3`) illustrates why adding additional loans to finance the purchase of investment goods is of secondary importance, as it would increase both $`FIN_i`$ and $`FIN_f`$ by the same amount, leaving their difference unchanged.

Notice that firms' total profit is defined residually as:

$$
\Pi = Y - w \cdot N_d - r_l \cdot L_d \quad \text{(C.4)}
$$

Using the GDP equation (`B.5`) into the profit equation (`C.4`), and the latter into the loans equation (`C.3`), we obtain:

$$
\Delta L_d = I_d - AF \quad \text{(C.5)}
$$

Equation (`C.5`) matches equation (`B.8`). At the end of each period, the change in the stock of loans to the firms equals the portion of investment ($I_d$) that is not funded by internal funds (here $`AF`$).

The reason is exactly the explanation provided by MCT theorists: firms remain (further) indebted to the banking system for an amount that equals the new bank deposits. The latter *ex post* always match the investment that has not been covered by private saving. Note that this conclusion remains valid even if firms are assumed to issue securities and/or retain a different share of profits (see [here](https://augustograziani.com/2022/09/18/sequence-and-class-divide-a-reply-to-the-critics-of-the-theory-of-the-monetary-circuit/) for a thorough discussion and [here](https://www.deps.unisi.it/it/ricerca/pubblicazioni-deps/quaderni-deps/anno-2023-da-n894-n/903-technical-change-and-monetary) for a more advanced presentation).

## B4_Model_IO-PC

There are currently only a few prototype input-output SFC models, despite recent progress ([Berg, Hartley, and Richters, 2015](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/17/1/015011); [Jackson and Jackson, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2024.108507); [Valdecantos, 2023](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355453717_Grasping_Argentina's_Green_Transition_Insights_from_a_Stock-Flow_Consistent_Input-Output_Model)). Integrating IO and SFC techniques poses challenges, but it is crucial for analysing both technical progress ([Veronese Passarella, 2023](https://www.deps.unisi.it/sites/st02/files/allegatiparagrafo/07-09-2023/903.pdf)) and the interaction of the ecosystem with the economy ([Hardt and O’Neill, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800916303202)).

Model IO-PC is an input-output extension of Model PC, where **IO** stands for "input-output structure".

In comparison to Model PC, additional assumptions include:

1. Two industries are considered (within the firms sector)

1. Only circulating capital is used

1. Technical coefficients are fixed

1. Each industry uses only one technique to produce one product

1. Prices are determined by reproduction conditions

1. The composition of both consumption and government spending is exogenously defined

It is also assumed that the marginal propensity to consume out of income is a negative function of the interest rate (as an increase in $r$ redistributes income from the wage earners to the rentiers, and the latter are marked by a lower propensity to consume). Based on these assumptions, a few additional equations are required to transform Model PC into Model IO-PC.

Notice that scalars are represented using *italic characters*, whereas vectors and matrices are represented using non-italic characters hereafter.

Column vector defining *composition of real consumption* (behavioural):

$$**\text{B}_c** = **\bar{\text{B}}_c** \quad \text{(13)} $$  

where $\mathrm{B_c} = [ B_{c1} \text{ }  B_{c2} ]$ and $B_{c1} + B_{c2} = 1$.

Column vector defining *composition of real government expenditure* (behavioural):

$$**\text{B}_g** = **\bar{\text{B}}_g** \quad \text{(14)} $$  

where $\mathrm{B_g} = [ B_{g1} \text{ } B_{g2} ]$ and $B_{g1} + B_{g2} = 1$.

Column vector of *final demands in real terms* (identity):

$$**\text{d}** = **\text{B}_c** \cdot c + **\text{B}_g** \cdot g \quad \text{(15)} $$  

Column vector of *real gross outputs* (identity):

$$**\text{x}** = **\text{A}** \cdot **\text{x}** + **\text{d}**, ~ with: **\text{A}**= \left(\begin{array}{cc} a_{11} & a_{12} \\
                                                                        a_{21} & a_{22}
                                                                        \end{array}\right) \quad \text{(16)} $$  

Modified equation for *national income* (identity):

$$Y = **\text{p}^T** \cdot **\text{d}** \quad \text{(1.A)} $$

Column vector of *unit prices of reproduction* (behavioural):

$$**\text{p}** = \frac{w}{**\text{pr}**} + ( **\text{p}**^T \cdot **\text{A}** ) \cdot (1 + \mu) \quad \text{(17)} $$

where $w$ is the (uniform) wage rate, $\mathrm{pr}$ is the vector of labour productivities, and $\mu$ is the (uniform) profit rate.

*Average consumer price* (identity):

$$p_c = **\text{p}^T** \cdot **\text{B}_c** \quad \text{(18)} $$  

*Average price for the government* (identity):

$$p_g = **\text{p}^T** \cdot **\text{B}_g** \quad \text{(19)} $$  

*Real consumption function* (behavioural):
$$c = \alpha_1 \cdot \left( \frac{YD}{p_c} - \pi \cdot \frac{V_{-1}}{p_c} \right) + \alpha_2 \cdot \frac{V_{-1}}{p_{c,-1}} \quad \text{(5.A)} $$

where $\pi$ is the rate of growth of the consumer price index (inflation rate), as consumers are assumed not to suffer from monetary illusion.

Note: the superscript $T$ stands for the transpose of the matrix, turning a column vector into a row vector. 

Equations (`13`) to (`19`) are additional ones. Equations (`1.A`) and (`5.A`) replace equations (`1`) and (`5`) of Model PC, respectively. Nominal consumption in equation (`4`) and nominal government spending in equation (`8`) are redefined as $p_c \cdot c$ and $p_g \cdot g$, respectively. The main code for developing Model IO-PC and conducting experiments can be found [here](https://github.com/marcoverpas/EAEPE_summer_school_2024/blob/main/eaepe_io_model.R).

Using the hidden equation, **Figure 1** demonstrates that the model is watertight, while **Figure 2** illustrates that the evolution of the main macro variables towards the steady state exactly matches that of a standard (aggregative) SFC model. However, unlike a standard SFC model, Model IO-PC also allows for the accounting of the input-output structure of the economy.

The input-output matrix of Model IO-PC is shown in **Table 3**.

#### Table 3. Simplified input-output matrix

**Table 3** illustrates cross-industry interdependencies in a simplified economy where two products are produced using the same products and labour.

These interdependencies are also depicted in the chart below. Specifically, **Figure 3** shows the final demands for each product, while **Figure 4** details the inputs required by each industry to produce their respective outputs.

Figures 1 to 4 show the evolution of model variables over time. Sankey diagrams can be used to take snapshots of the economy in a specific period.

Alternatively, network graphs can be used, which look a bit trivial for a 2-industry model (like Model IO-PC), but can provide useful information when a number $`n>2`$ of industries is considered:

## B5_Model_ECO-IO-PC

Although the origins of ecological macroeconomics can be traced back to the inception of economics itself, early SFC models for economic research did not incorporate the ecosystem.

This gap was bridged in the late 2010s (Dafermos, Nikolaidi, and Galanis, 2016, 2018; Jackson and Victor, 2015). The primary characteristic of ecological SFC models is their integration of monetary variables (following Godley and Lavoie, 2008) with physical variables (in line with Georgescu-Roegen, 1971) in a consistent manner. Several ECO-SFC models have been developed since then.

Here we consider a simple extension of Model IO-PC, named Model ECO-IO-PC, where **ECO** stands for "ecological". Additional assumptions are as follows:

1. there are 2 types of reserves: matter and energy

1. there are 2 types of energy: renewable and non-renewable

1. Resources are converted into reserves at a certain rate

1. Industrial CO2 emissions are associated with the use of non-renewable energy

1. Atmospheric temperature is a growing function of CO2 emissions

1. Both goods from industry 1 and industry 2 can be durable or non-durable

1. A share of durable goods (hence socio-economic stock) is discarded in every period

1. Both waste and emissions are produced only by the firm sector

Behavioural equations draw inspiration from the works of [Dafermos, Nikolaidi, and Galanis (2016, 2018)](https://define-model.org/). The main code of Model ECO-IO-PC is available [here](https://github.com/marcoverpas/EAEPE_summer_school_2024/blob/main/eaepe_eco_model.R). New variables and coefficients are defined between line 88 and line 125. The blocks providing the additional equations for the ecosystem are those included between line 252 and 333.

Firstly, extractions of matter and waste are modelled.

Production of *material goods*:

$$ x_{mat} = **\text{m}_{mat}^T** \cdot **\text{x}** \quad \text{(20)} $$

where $\text{m}_{mat}$ is the vector of material intensity coefficients by industry.

*Extraction* of matter:

$$mat = x_{mat} - rec \quad \text{(21)} $$

*Recycled* matter:

$$rec = \rho_{dis} \cdot dis \quad \text{(22)} $$

where $\rho_{dis}$ is the recycling rate of discarded products.

*Discarded* socioeconomic stock:  

$$dis = **\text{m}_{mat}^T** \cdot (**\text{z}_{dc}** \odot **\text{dc}_{-1}**) \quad \text{(23)} $$

where $\text{z}_{dc}$ is the vector defining the percentages of discarded socio-economic stock by industry.

Stock of *durable goods*:

$$ **\text{dc}** = **\text{dc}_{-1}** + **\text{B}_c** \cdot c - **\text{z}_{dc}** \cdot **\text{dc}_{-1}** \quad \text{(24)} $$

*Socioeconomic stock*:

$$k_h = k_{h,-1} + x_{mat} - dis \quad \text{(25)} $$

*Waste*:

$$wa = mat - (k_h - k_{h,-1}) \quad \text{(26)} $$

Secondly, energy use and CO2 emissions are considered.

*Total energy* required for production:

$$en = **\text{e}_{en}^T** \cdot **\text{x}** \quad \text{(27)} $$

where $\text{e}_{en}$ is the vector that defines the energy intensity coefficients by industry.

*Renewable* energy at the end of the period:

$$ren = **\text{e}_{en}^T** \cdot (**\text{a}_{en}** \odot **\text{x}** )    \quad \text{(28)}      $$

where $\text{a}_{en}$ is the vector that defines the industry-specific shares of renewable energy to total energy.

*Non-renewable* energy:

$$nen = en - ren \quad \text{(29)} $$

Annual flow of *CO2 emissions*:

$$emis = \beta_{e} \cdot nen \quad \text{(30)} $$

where $\beta_{e}$ is the CO2 intensity coefficient of non-renewable energy sources.

*Cumulative* emissions:

$$co2_{cum} = co2_{cum,-1} + emis \quad \text{(31)} $$

Atmospheric *temperature*:

$$temp = \frac{1}{1-fnc} \cdot tcre \cdot co2_{cum} \quad \text{(32)} $$

where $fnc$ is the non-CO2 fraction of total anthropocentric forcing and $tcre$ is the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions.

Thirdly, the dynamics of reserves is modelled.

Stock of *matter reserves*:

$$k_m = k_{m,-1} + conv_m - mat \quad \text{(33)} $$

Matter resources *converted* to reserves:

$$conv_m = \sigma_{m} \cdot res_m \quad \text{(34)} $$

where $\sigma_{m}$ is the conversion rate of matter resources into reserves.

Stock of *matter resources*:

$$res_m = res_{m,-1} - conv_m \quad \text{(35)} $$

*Carbon mass* of non-renewable energy:

$$cen = \frac{emis}{car} \quad \text{(36)} $$

where $car$ is the coefficient converting Gt of carbon into Gt of CO2.

Mass of *oxygen*:

$$o2 = emis - cen \quad \text{(37)} $$

Stock of *energy reserves*:

$$k_e = k_{e,-1} + conv_e - en \quad \text{(38)} $$

Energy resources *converted* to reserves:

$$conv_e = \sigma_e \cdot res_e \quad \text{(39)} $$

where $\sigma_e$ is the conversion rate of energy resources into reserves.

Stock of *energy resources*:

$$res_e = res_{e,-1} - conv_e \quad \text{(40)} $$

Lastly, feedback effects and damages can be introduced. Here the
assumption is made that the propensity to consume out of income is
(negatively) influenced by climate change.

New *propensity to consume* out of income:

$$\alpha_1 = \alpha_{10} - \alpha_{11} \cdot r_{-1} - \alpha_{12} \cdot \Delta temp \quad \text{(12.A)} $$

where $\alpha_{12}$ is a positive coefficient.

The related physical constraints (used to define ecosystem identities) are displayed by **Table 4** and **Table 5**, in which matter is expressed in $Gt$ and energy is expressed in $EJ$.

A dynamic rendition of the model is provided in the new **Figure 3** and **Figure 4**, which now show the evolution over time of matter and energy reserves, and the atmospheric temperature, respectively.

Note that the new **Figure 1** and **Figure 2** demonstrate that the behavior of the economy is qualitatively unchanged, except for the effect of the rise in temperature on consumption.  

#### APPENDIX: ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS

A simple experiment is to increase the (negative) temperature elasticity of the propensity to consume out of income. More precisely, it is assumed here that $\alpha_{12}$ quadruples (see the complete model code [here](https://github.com/marcoverpas/EAEPE_summer_school_2024/blob/main/eaepe_eco_model_plus.R)).

The figures above show that, while a higher sensitivity of consumption to an increase in temperature leads to an initial reduction in economic activity and environmental impacts, the situation reverses in the long run. This is because the private sector accumulates a higher stock of government bills, which, in turn, implies a higher flow of interest payments and thus a higher disposable income in the long run. Note that the level of the interest rate becomes a crucial variable for the determination of such rebound effects. 

## B6_Policy_Implications

The main policy implications derived from SFC models are as follows:

- The effects of monetary policy are less straightforward than typically assumed. Higher (lower) interest rates discourage (support) private spending and may appreciate (depreciate) the currency, but they also increase (reduce) the disposable income of government debt holders.

- As long as full employment is not achieved, fiscal policy is generally found to be more effective than monetary policy in supporting the economy.

- The most important constraint on expansionary fiscal policies is the current account balance.

- There is no single, socially-optimal economic equilibrium, as today's position depends on past conditions and policies.

- Environmental policies are likely to involve trade-offs, as their effects vary across social groups, benefiting some while disadvantaging others.
